# Introduction


This is an attempt to reproduce the anaylses presented in the paper *A global synthesis reveals biodiversity loss as a major
driver of ecosystem change by Hooper et al. 2012 ([http://jarrettbyrnes.info/pdfs/Hooper_et_al_2012_Nature.pdf]). 

* From the article summary:
There is evidence that extinctions are altering key processes important to the productivity and sustainability of Earth’s eco- systems. Further species loss will accelerate change in ecosystem processes, but it is unclear how these effects compare to the direct effects of other forms of environmental change that are both driving diversity loss and altering ecosystem function. 
The authors used a suite of meta-analyses of published data to show that the effects of species loss on productivity and decomposition — two processes important in all ecosystems — are of comparable magnitude to the effects of many other global environmental changes. 
NUMBER OF SPECIES LOSS: In experiments, intermediate levels of species loss (21–40%) reduced plant production by 5–10%, comparable to previously documented effects of ultraviolet radiation and climate warming. Higher levels of extinction (41–60%) had effects rivalling those of ozone, acidification, elevated CO2 and nutrient pollution. At intermediate levels, species loss generally had equal or greater effects on de- composition than did elevated CO2 and nitrogen addition. 
IDENTITY OF SPECIES LOSS: The identity of species lost also had a large effect on changes in pro- ductivity and decomposition, generating a wide range of plausible outcomes for extinction.

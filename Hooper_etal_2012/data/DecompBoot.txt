Citation: meta-analysis reference
nobs: number of observations for log response ratio (ln.RR)
resp.var: meta-analysis response variable. decomp rate = decomposition rate. % mass rem = percent of initial litter mass remaining. % mass loss = percent of initial litter mass lost. microbial breakdown rate, undefined = unclear from meta-analysis.
factor: meta-analysis factor analyzed. acid = acification. CO2 = elevated CO2. invasion = plant invasion. N = nitrogen additions. eutrophication = addition of multiple nutrients (aquatic)
ln.RR: log response ratio.
CI.max = If CI.type = symm, this is the value that was added and subtracted from the mean ln.RR to generate the 95% CI. If CI.type = symm, this is the larger of the two values that were added and subtracted from the mean to generate the 95% CI.
CI.L = lower 95% confidence interval value.
CI.U = upper 95% confidence interval value.
CI.type = asymetrical (a) or symmetrical (symm).
Err.orig = type of error reported in meta-analysis. CI = 95% confidence interval. SD = standard deviation. SE = standard error.
Err.orig.num = value of error type reported in meta-analysis (only for SD and SE). No value (NA) is entered in this column if Err.orig = CI.

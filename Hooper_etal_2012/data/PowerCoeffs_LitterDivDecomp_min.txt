Entry	Unique identifier for each observation (row) in the Cardinale dataset.
Study	Unique identifier for each study summarized in the Cardinale dataset.
Expt	Unique identifier for each experiment included in the Cardinale dataset.
Smax	Maximum level of richness included in the study.
powa	Maximum likelihood estimates of a from a linearized version of the power function ln(Yi/Y1) = a + b*ln(S) where Yi is the value of Y at richness S, and Y1 is the mean monoculture value of Y at S = 1. 
powb	Maximum likelihood estimates of b from a linearized version of the power function ln(Yi/Y1) = a + b*ln(S) where Yi is the value of Y at richness S, and Y1 is the mean monoculture value of Y at S = 1. 
Smin	Minimum level of richness included in the study.
FinalT  Is data in this row from the final time point included in the study? Yes (Y) or no (N).

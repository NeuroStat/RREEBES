## 14.06.2016
Minutes by Ale

### Attendance
Frank, Vanessa, Aurelie, Ale, Andrea, Mikael

### Highlights
About the "Methods meetings", we wrote down all that we can teach others and we will vote them through an online tool until next week. After that we will start with meetings once a week. 
If there are more things that we want to learn but that are not in that list, please send it to Ale, so she compiles a file and next week we will decide what to do with that (maybe call people to give talks for us). 

### Today's presentation
Vanessa presented the progress in her paper. 

### Next presentations planning
Next week Aurelie (and Ale if she actually gets on board with it) will present her paper. 

## 07.06.2016
Minutes by Aurelie

###Attendance 
* Frank, Mikael, Andrea, Aurelie, Ale

### Highlights
* Mikael is looking for a new reproduction. His interest would be Toni *et al.* and he will team up with Andrea and Frank (as soon as they finish their on-going reproduction)
* Discussion about "why some reproductions take too much time?" 
We should consider that a reproduction is not only to learn a new method but it should be enjoyable in order to increase productivity.
* Discussion about **Methods sessions**. 
   * about 30-45 minutes, once a months (schedule in the group calendar)
   * possible topics: statistics, ABC, meta-anlysis, machine learning, etc.
   * we should advertise these sessions (as well as the RREEBES) to the department... but having a larger group might be dangerous.

### Next presentations planning:
* 14th June: Vanessa
* Next week everyone should prepare five methods that they would like to *learn* and five methods that they would be happy to *teach*.

## 3.05.2016
No meeting


##26.04.2016
No meeting


##19.04.2016
###Attendance

Vanessa, Alejandra, Frank

Minutes by Alejandra

###Highlights

- no new faces.

- no uploaded papers, but Mikael will add 2.

- issues solved: deleted Graham branch / Owen should check the issues concerning Beninca, to see if they can be closed / please all check regularly the issues to see if they can be asssessed and closed.

- papers with reproduction underway: please clear it (is it done?=move it). Moved Hooper paper to "done".

- Alejandra will maybe start working with Aurelie in her paper. 

###Presentation

We went through the Simplex projection. Frank went with us through the htlm, explaining different points. 
We learned: Chaos within some deterministic processes produces patterns. He showed us how to construct the Embeddings with the Embed function. Then how to look at patterns: first you find the embeddings, then you look for those that are similar with a distance matrix.  Then Frank talk about dimentionality, what is it and how it is related to the linearity or not of the series and how this is related to the number of embeddings you need to predict.  

###Homework for next meeting

Read "Sugihara et al 2012 Fig3A" 


##12.04.2016
Attending: Frank, Mikael Aurelie, Willfredo

Minutes by Mikael
- No new faces
 
-No uploaded papers to reproduce

-Mikael suggested to uploading Sisson et al 2007 and Beamount 2010 on ABC and SMC for future reproductions. This reproduction could also be part of a “computational statistics series” that may fit well in RREEBES.

-Frank’s presentation of Git and github is uploaded to SLAK and will stay there for everyone to see and revisit.

-Frank reported on his and Andrea’s reproduction using simplex projection to predict time series dynamics. 

-We decided to read the “Simplex projection walkthrough” published by Owen on github for next week.

Next week we will go through the “Simplex projection walkthrough”.

## 16.2.2016
Minutes by Frank    
Attendance: Aurélie, Andrea, Frank, Vanessa, Owen (by Skype), Colette, Mikael

Presentation by Vanessa about her reproduction of Xiong et al.:   
- transcriptome analysis on Tetrahymena thermophila during three life stages (growth, starvation, conjugation)
- main goal: learn the methods used by the authors to do transcriptome analysis
- paper already a couple of years old, so difficulty of getting the proper versions of the software used. However, as it is more about learning the tools, newer versions of software and algorithms will be used and consistency with previous results checked.
- challenges with data size with consists of multiple gigabyte sized files

Owen has produced an almost final version of the Beninca et al. 2008 reproduction, ready to be submitted to ReScience asap

Owen has added some analysis to the Ward et al. 2014 reproduction due to some recent discussions of the paper in a journal club at Gainesville University:
- instead of asking what is the best method across all time series, he looked how the error decreases overall by always chosing the best model for a particular time series

Next presentations: Frank, Aurélie and then Colette or Andrea

## 9.2.2016
Minutes by Frank    
Attendance: Aurélie, Andrea, Frank, Vanessa, Thomas, Owen (by Skype), Colette    

Presentation by Aurélie about the reasons why the Hooper et al. reproduction will not be continued:   
- main problem is access to the raw data needed for estimating effect sizes with metafor package  
- authors provided code for some figures that worked well, however, access to code limits motivation to do the cumbersome reproduction yourself   
- still some lessons learned during the reproduction about data integration and different types of errors one has to deal with during meta-analysis
- branch will be merged to master and reproduced bits published on the github page

Andrea and Colette will think about papers they want to reproduce (hint: Thomas looks for help on reproducing the Allesina paper on food webs)   

next presentations by Vanessa and Frank   

## 26.01.2016
No meeting

## 19.01.2016

## 12.01.2016
Minutes by Pablo

## Attendance
Mikael, Frank, Thomas, Pablo, David, Aurélie, Gian Marco

## Progress update
We discussed the planning for the RREEBES in 2016. Mikael and Frank let the people know about the ideas of the last meeting.
We decided to start effectively the reproductions in the next week meeting (19.01), when Mikael will present the reproduction of the paper Ito and Dieckmann 2007. 
Aurélie, Alejandra and Pablo will present the Hooper et al (2012) paper in the next week or the next. 

## 05.01.2016
Minutes by Mikael

## Attendance
Mikael, Frank, Thomas, Pablo and David

## Introduction by Mikael
We discussed where we want to take REEBES for the year 2016.
    
Mikael suggested that REEBES could be more of journal club were papers and analyses are discussed such that all group members get some insights to all papers. Rather than having each person reading the updates on github or even waiting for the full report to be finished the REBEES meetings can be used more as a presentation and discussion forum. One or two groups could, for example, walk the group through what was done so far in the reproduction and more importantly explain why the analyses were done in the paper.
 
Suggested guidelines for REEBES meetings:  
- Each group introduces the paper before a reproduction starts such that all know what the paper is about and why it is relevant for REEBES and the Petchey group.
 
- At least ones a month each group walks the others through their reproduction and explain what and why the analysis was done. This forces the reproducers to understand the analyses and circumvents the issue of using available code without understanding what it does.
 
Frank suggested having recurrent recap of the tools that lay at hand (e.g git, github and R) for our reproduction. Similar to the R-lunch such recaps can involve presentations of the tools (by e.g. Frank) and jointly solving problems that the groups might have experienced during resent reproductions. This will help each of us reproduce science in REEBES and make our own science better and reproducible.
  
Frank also suggested to have sessions were the group learns more about reproducible science in general. Why is reproducibility important? What facilitates reproducibility? By answering these questions we can change parts of our day to day work towards better reproducibility. 

Thomas suggested having some common template for our reproductions posted on github. In particular it is important to introduce the paper properly and to explain why certain analyses were done.

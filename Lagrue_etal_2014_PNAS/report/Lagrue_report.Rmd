# Introduction

This is an attempt to reproduce the anaylses presented in the paper *Parasitism alters three power laws of scaling in a metazoan community: Taylorâ€™s law, density-mass allometry, and variance-mass allometry*, by Lagrue, Poulin, and Cohen ([http://www.pnas.org/content/112/6/1791](http://www.pnas.org/content/112/6/1791)). Data are [here](http://www.pnas.org/content/suppl/2014/12/30/1422475112.DCSupplemental/pnas.1422475112.sd01.txt) as a txt, but need to be saved as csv.

* Here include some text about what is presented below in the basic reproduction, and what additional was done and where that is described.

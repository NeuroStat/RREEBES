This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
library(igraph)

```



```{r}
dd.01 <- read.csv("~/SWITCHdrive/UZH/GitHub/RREEBES/MORALES-CASTILLA_etal_2015_TREE/Serengeti data/journal.pcbi.1002321.s004.csv")
dd.02 <- read.csv("~/SWITCHdrive/UZH/GitHub/RREEBES/MORALES-CASTILLA_etal_2015_TREE/Serengeti data/journal.pcbi.1002321.s005.csv")
dd.03 <- read.csv("~/SWITCHdrive/UZH/GitHub/RREEBES/MORALES-CASTILLA_etal_2015_TREE/Serengeti data/journal.pcbi.1002321.s006.csv")

```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}

```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

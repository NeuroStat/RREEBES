The paper uses multivariate autoregressive models (introduced in "Quantifying effects of abiotic and biotic drivers on community dynamics with multivariate autoregressive (MAR) models", http://www.esajournals.org/doi/full/10.1890/13-0996.1), which maybe an interesting approach for our BEEP data. We need to check data availability, however, there are other potentially interesting papers using the approach, if we cannot get the data of this one.

TMM: How do historical patterns of environmental variation influence the resilience of competitively structured communities to a change in the environmet? Is the community resilient (i.e., returning to its pre-perturbed state) or is its performance highly contingent on the past environment (i.e., approaching a different state)? To answer these questions, Hawkes & Keitt employ a simulation model including physiological, community and evolutionary mechanisms.

TREE xx 1-10](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0169534715000774) TMM: Would be interesting to reproduce this study to get an idea about the removed interactions (the forbidden ones) - and the ones that are still in, but false. Maybe one could also apply this to a smaller food web and test for the accuracy of this approach. Because the authors do not provide any test for accuracy... :( Food webs available, checking for trait data. Thomas, GM, Vanessa.
